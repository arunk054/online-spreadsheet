Homework/Mini Project:

Spreadsheet with  dataflow and persistence
==========================================

In this  last part of the spreadsheet, you need to implement the following 3 features:

1. Dataflow:

a. Computation of dependencies of cells based on occurrence
   of those cells in the formula.  

b. Updating of dependencies when a formula changes

c. Flagging circular dependencies and rejecting any formula
   that causes circularity to appear. 


2. Recomputation of formulas in the presence of addition/deletion of rows.

a. Implement a new operation called (sum <index1> <index2>)
   where index1 and index2 are co-axial (share the same row
   or same column). The formula using sum should
   automatically be readjusted if a row or column in the
   middle of the <index1>...<index.2> is added/deleted.

b. Flag a formula cell as error when a row or column
   containing the cell whose address in a formula is deleted.
   [You should simulate the behaviour of what happens in Open
   office.  Try it out.]

3. Persistence of spreadsheet.  

a. Save the entire spreadsheet data structure 

b. Reread the spreadsheet back into the browser and ensure
   that everything works as before.

c. (Optional) periodic saving of spreadsheet using AJAX.


Note: 

1. You may either submit this and the previous homework as
   separate submissions (to get partial credit), or submit one
   complete final mini project.

2. Feel free to discuss the problems on the net.  This is
   part of an exam.  Needless to say, I expect nothing but
   the highest standards of personal integrity from each of
   you.  You should consult each other as much as possible,
   and carry out the discussion in the open on the
   pas-course newsgroup, but do the implementation yourself.

   I dare say the implementation will be a life changing
   event for you.

This and the previous homework together will carry a total of

5% from the quiz weightage
5% from the  homework weightage
10% from final exam  (written exam is now worth 20%)

i.e., a total of 20% of the grade for the stream that I
taught.

SUBMISSION IS MANDATORY,  even if you do not complete the
implementation!  

The deadline is 11:59pm first day of classes next semester.

I expect the google group to be active.  I will be tuned in
to it. I look forward to your questions, and answers.  

Happy Holidays!

Sincerely,
